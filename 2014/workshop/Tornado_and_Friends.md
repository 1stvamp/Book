# Tornado and Friends workshop
## Learn how to write fast asynchronous web services with Tornado and Python

The world isn't blocking; why should your app be?

Asynchronous - *non-blocking* - I/O is a form of input/output processing that permits other processing to continue before the transmission has finished.

It's a technique that can help bypass bottlenecks in program operation, and vastly improve performance of software.

Tornado is an asynchronous networking library that can handle tens of thousands of open connections, and can readily be deployed alongside Django and other Python applications.
